프로젝트를 진행하면서 GO를 이용한 Server 구축을 공부해 보고자 GO syntax 정리에 앞서 설치와 환경설정을 먼저 다뤄본다. WSL2 와 MacOS 에 설치를 할 것이며 두 OS 모두 _oh my zsh_ 를 사용하고 있다.

## Test GO Online

[Test GO from online](https://replit.com/)

## Download Link

[Download GO from this link](https://golang.org/)

- See **Setup on WSL2** for Install Binary Distribution

## Setup on WSL2

1. Copy link address of the GO Linux version
2. Download the latest version and extract in the current directory

   ```
   $ wget https://golang.org/dl/go1.16.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
   $ sudo tar -svf go1.16.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz
   ```

   - `tar`: stores/extracts files from the archive
   - `x`: extracts the file from target
   - `v`: verbosly list files process
   - `f`: use archive file

3. Move the extracted go directory to /usr/local

   ```
   $ sudo mv go /usr/local
   ```

4. Set environment variables

   Open **Home** directory

   ```
   $ cd
   $ explorer.exe .
   ```

   Add global variables on `.bashsrc` or `.zhsrc`

   ```
   # Go Global variables
   export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
   export GOPATH=$HOME/go
   export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$GOROOT/bin:$PATH
   ```

## Setup on Mac

1. Open the package file you downloaded and follow the prompts to install Go.

   > The package installs the Go distribution to /usr/local/go. The package should put the /usr/local/go/bin directory in your PATH environment variable. You may need to restart any open Terminal sessions for the change to take effect.

2. Verify that you've installed Go by opening a command prompt and typing the following command:

   ```
   $ go version
   ```

3. Confirm that the command prints the installed version of Go.
